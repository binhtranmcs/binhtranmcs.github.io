As a software engineer, I find myself increasingly surrounded by the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in my daily life. From enhancing productivity to automating mundane tasks, AI is reshaping how I work and live.

I still vividly remember just a year ago when I was coding everything by myself. At that time, while AI technologies like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot were gaining traction, I never imagined I would use AI as extensively as I do today. Fast forward to now, and a significant portion of my code is written by AI agents. While I may not take pride in this reliance, I cannot deny the efficiency boost it provides. AI generates code rapidly, assists with boilerplate tasks, and automates testing. The process is straightforward: I share my ideas with the AI agent and guide it step by step toward my goals. One notable observation is that I rarely visit platforms like Quora nowadays; I simply ask AI, and the responses tend to meet my needs quite satisfactorily. Only when faced with extremely specific questions do I find myself needing to check resources like Quora or Stack Overflow.

Yet, I grapple with a concern about over-reliance on AI. I still want to code, but primarily when the tasks become too complex for AI to handle effectively. This serves as a reminder to continuously develop my skills. I envision utilizing AI as a coding assistant rather than a complete replacement. Alongside this, I realize the importance of improving my ability to manage and leverage AI effectively. There are moments when I find myself leaning too heavily on it, sometimes to the point of avoiding critical thinking. If this pattern continues, it could be detrimental to my skills and creativity. This reflection serves as a valuable reminder to strike a balance in using these powerful tools.

Interestingly, I’m using AI not only to code but also to articulate these thoughts effectively. In crafting this blog, I leveraged AI to outline my ideas, ensure coherence, and suggest engaging ways to present my experiences. This approach not only saves time but also elevates the quality of my writing, enabling me to focus on conveying the ideas that truly matter rather than getting bogged down in stylistic details.

In conclusion, AI has seamlessly woven itself into both my professional and personal life, fundamentally transforming how I work, interact, and express myself. Embracing these innovations goes beyond mere efficiency; it’s about unlocking new potentials and fostering creativity in everything we do. As I navigate this evolving landscape, I remind myself to maintain a thoughtful relationship with AI—one that enhances my skills rather than diminishes them.
